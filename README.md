## Problem

Mental health is often overlooked, and people may not always have a safe space to express their feelings. In moments of distress, having a simple way to reflect can make a difference. Many existing solutions focus on just one aspect, like providing resources, but do not personalize the experience or offer immediate support tailored to individual emotional states.amlit.app

## Solution

ReflectAI combines emotion analysis with personalized journaling prompts, mood tracking, and a daily affirmation system to help users stay grounded. The app leverages machine learning to analyze text for signs of distress, offering support in real-time and connecting users with helpful resources when necessary.
